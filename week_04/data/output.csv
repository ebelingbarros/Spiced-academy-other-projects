0,"You built this world around you, your universe In spite of best intentions, things could not be worse Chaos and fear left you hangin' by a thread As you argue with the voice inside your head Untethered angel Falling into darkness Don't be afraid of letting go Givin' up yourself won't set you free Misgivings and dismay, nightmares of wasted days Can't live your life this way, something needs to change Healthy, accepting thoughts, intent on driving us Avoidance at all costs, a painful thing to watch Fear can't live inside you Push you to the edge Face the fear within you Wake up from the dead Untethered angel Falling into darkness Don't be afraid of letting go Givin' up yourself won't set you free Set you free Untethered angel Falling into darkness Don't be afraid of letting go Open your heart, be set free",Dream Theater
1,"The anger, the pressure You're choking down your words again Feel the nerves set in Unspoken frustration They see right through you Paper thin, like the ghost within A heart that feels no pain Addicted to the game Breaking beneath the strain I am paralyzed The stare of a stranger Is like a wound that bleeds again Silent as the dead The victim, the martyr Like Daniel in the lion's den Time and time again A heart that feels no pain Addicted to the game Breaking beneath the strain I am paralyzed I am paralyzed A heart that feels no pain Addicted to the game Relentless mental trait? What do you stand to gain? Viewing life through such a narrow, fractured lens We'll ensure you end up on the losing end Breaking beneath the string I am paralyzed I am paralyzed I am paralyzed I am paralyzed I am paralyzed",Dream Theater
2,"Written on the water, memories dissipate Eyes begin to open, darkness drifts away Time and space like roses, whose petals drop and fade And fall into the light as it dreams of yesterday Too much love is not enough for us I was once too blind to see There is nothing sacred, only heaven knows So turn towards the self and look into your soul Too much love is not enough for us I was once too blind to see Too much hope will never be enough It's become so clear to me Too much love is not enough for us I was once too blind to see Too much hope will never be enough The truth is clear to me",Dream Theater
3,"In a dark and lonely corner, all the time in Dark-side inn Sits a local barstool warrior, talking to his gin Treating past decisions, he motions for a shot Is he doomed to be a man this world forgot? Just a prisoner of the monster on his back Call it bad luck, call it fate Call it stuck here the rest of my days Serves me right, what went wrong And where do I belong? In the glow of flashing lights, on the shoulder of the road Clutching at the bruised and tired skin She tries to signal danger with anguish in her eyes Will he see the world of pain she's in? Or is it too late? Was it bad luck, was it fate Or a past that she couldn't escape? It's not right, something's wrong Just where do I belong? Promises made, crying in vain All empty, never accepting the blame And not letting go of the shame A river of tears, as months turned to years All wasted on someone not willing to change Now only a shadow remains No one can save you And there's no one to see It has been written You will become all you think, all you feel, all you dream Now I'm cutting the anchor away And I won't look back I'm starting a new life today Now I see where I belong",Dream Theater

5,"Are we paying attention or are we drifting? Too much negative action, not enough positive reaction What's the state of humanity? Where's the peace and the harmony? Free the signal, your inner voice Time to transcend, block out the noise Signal to noise becomes the answer The world keeps turning as we latch on to the wheel Have you heard the news?

7,"There's something about this girl, some kind of magic I swear she cast a spell on me Not the first time, might be the last Can't let this moment slip away Try to find the words, none survived with me Air of confidence, but I can barely breathe She's without a care, electrified and hell-bent A thousand volts igniting me The waves crash over me, far below but I breach The undertow, my reverie Sadness in her smile, your love, it's been a while Near and far away, she chases it each day A promise to come back, all the while, still waiting Seems it lost its way Out of reach, just too hard to reach You're letting your love slip away Out of reach, yeah, it's hard to reach There's another day Although you're hurting and afraid You're stronger than yesterday",Dream Theater
8,"So far away from home, beyond a distant reach Faith whispers from the edge, returning piece by piece A lonely point of light, captured in a final glance A solitary hint of life, discovered it by chance God creators, dream destroyers Spineless cowards and fearless warriors Hopeful children, mothers and fathers Our blood filled river's fueled by hate We worship heroes, kings and saints But who's out there to save us from ourselves?

I can't hold on any longer These feelings keep growing stronger Echoes that deafen the mind will bury my voice in their wake Caught in a Web Removed from the world Hanging on by a thread Spinning the lies devised in my head I've seen the path the one you take shows the truth for you to make This turn of phrase we might not see is the thirst of desire found so easily Try to push me 'round the world some more And make me live in fear I bare all that I am made of now Attractive I don't care 'Cause even when I danced with life no one was there to share Does this voice the wounds of your soul? Does this voice the wounds of your soul? Caught in a Web Removed from the world Hanging on by a thread Spinning the lies devised in my head Tried to live the life you live and saw It doesn't work for me I bare all that I am made of now Attractive, I can't be Inside the Dance of Life is one I'll never hold to me You can't heal the wounds of my soul. You can't heal the wounds of my soul.

19,"Subconscious strange sensation Unconscious relaxation What a pleasant nightmare And I can't wait to get there again Every time I close my eyes There's another vivid surprise Another whole life waiting Chapters unfinished, fading Closer now, Slowly coming into view I've arrived, Blinding sunshine beaming through There's a house I'm drawn into Familiar settings, nothing new There's a pathway leading there With a haunting chill in the air There's room at the top of the stairs Every night I'm drawn up there There's a girl in the mirror Her face is getting clearer Young child won't you tell me why I'm here? In her eyes I sense a story never told Behinde the disguise There's something tearing At her soul Tonight I've been searching for it A feeling that's deep inside m Tonight I've been searching for The one that nobody knows Trying to break free I just can't help myself I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head Tears my heart into two I'm not the one the sleeper thought he knew Back on my feet again Eyes open to real world Metropolis surrounds me The mirror's shattered the girl Why is this other life Haunting me everyday I'd break through the other side If only I'd find the way Something's awfully familiar The feeling's so hard to shake Could I have lived in that other world It's a link that I'm destined to make I'm still searching but I don't know what for The missing key to unlock my mind's door Today I am searching for it A feeling that won't go away Today I am searching for it The only one I know Trying to break free I just can't help myself I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head Tears my soul into two I'm not the one I thought I always knew I just can't help myself I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head Uncanny, strange Deja Vu But I don't mind I hope to find the truth",Dream Theater
20,He seems alone and silent Thoughts remain without an answer Afraid and uninvited He slowly drifts away Moved by desire and fear Breaking delicate wings Lifting shadows Off a Dream once broken She can turn a drop of water Into an ocean As the rain is pouring down Tears of sorrow wash his mind Drifting with the current This stream of life flows on He seems alone and silent Waiting on his hands and knees The chill of winter's darkness sits quietly Moved by desire and fear He takes a few steps away Lifting shadows Off a Dream once broken She can turn a drop of water Into an ocean And she listens openly He pours his soul into the water Reflecting the mystery She carries him away And the winds die slowly And she listens openly And she listens openly Lifting shadows Off a Dream once broken She can turn a drop of water Into an ocean Lifting Shadows off a Dream Lifting Shadows off a Dream,Dream Theater

24,"Alone at night I feel so strange I need to find All the answers to my dreams When I sleep at night I hear the cries What does this mean? I shut the door and traveled to another home I met an older man, he seemed to be alone I felt that I could trust him He talked to me that night; ""Lad did you know a girl was murdered here?"" ""This fatal tragedy was talked about for years"" Victoria's gone forever Only memories remain She passed away She was so young Without love Without truth There can be no turning back Without faith Without hope There can be no peace of mind As the night went on I started to find my way I learned about a tragedy A mystery still today I tried to get more answers But he said, ""You're on your own."" Then he turned away and left me As I stand there all alone He said, ""You'll know the truth As you future days unfold"" Without love Without truth There can be no turning back Without faith Without hope There can be no peace of mind ""Now it is time to see how you died. Remember that death is not the end but only a transition.""",Dream Theater

30,"A suited man smiled said ""It's just a matter of time You can have the world at your feet by tomorrow Just sign on this line"" Hold tight limelight Approaching the paramount With the sun in our eyes Fearing family ties, legalizes, compromise In a dimly lit room with a stool as his stage A dream stricken prince of a pauper's descent Haunts the eavesdropping silence That presses his window As he sweats a performance To an audience that ticks on the walls To the practical observer It's just a matter of time You can deviate from the common place Only to fall back in line I understand mine's a risky plan And your system can't miss But is security after all a 'cause Or symptom of happiness? Brave, yet afraid, his eyes on the horizon In a steady set gaze A mariner soon from an open cocoon Takes a moment to summon his courage To stifle his grave apprehension And trembling, approaches the surf A father's benediction as his hopeful son departs To brave the sea of rage and conquer at all costs Lingers in his memory And visions still surviving in a logic-proof shell That should have been held sacred, safe and hidden well Are compromised in usury With every rising sun that yields no sight of land The hesitation cultivates within the tired man And rumors spread of mutiny And though the time will come when dream and day unite Tonight the only consolation causing him to fight Is fearless faith in destiny Even when plan fall to pieces I can still find the courage With promise I've found in my faith Likely or not, it's a dream that we keep And at odds with our senses we'll climb But if faith is the answer, we've already reached it And if spirit's a sign Then it's only a matter of time Only a matter of time",Dream Theater

Do you even know your name?"" Then he shined a light into my eyes and said ""Take this for the pain"" Hopelessly drifting, bathing in beautiful agony I am endlessly falling, lost in this wonderful misery In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake and thought of the panic inside starts to fade Hopelessly drifting, bathing in beautiful agony ""Tell me, does this hurt you?"" said the faceless man ""Can you move all of your fingers? Can you try your best to stand?"" I asked about the others ""Is everyone okay?"" He told me not to worry as he turned and looked away Hopelessly drifting, bathing in beautiful agony I am endlessly falling, lost in this wonderful misery In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake and thought of the panic inside starts to fade Hopelessly drifting, bathing in beautiful agony Day after day and night after night Replaying the events Did they ever see the red light? Over and over, scene by scene Like a recurring nightmare haunting my dreams How can you prepare for what would happen next? No son should ever have to see his father such a mess It's a miracle he lived, it's a blessing no one died By the grace of God above, everyone survived Life was so simple then We were so innocent It will stay with us forever A nightmare to remember",Dream Theater

Today, a savior, Tonight, I am the new messiah you deify. When I'm no longer desired, I'll be crucified. The one who's free from sin, The first to cast the stone. Fighting the fear within, I won't be left alone. You build me up, you break me down Until I'm falling to pieces. The price I pay to live this way, And the fantasy stays alive. I can't live up, I can't let down And leave you falling to pieces. I crash and burn, I never learn, I'm your morning obsession. Build me up! Break me down! (I will be your savior) You build me up, you break me down Until I'm falling to pieces. The price I pay to live this way, And the fantasy stays alive. I can't live up, I can't let down And leave you falling to pieces. I crash and burn, I never learn, Your iconic fixation. Build me up! Break me down! Build me up! Break me down!",Dream Theater

We will comprehend the word serenity, and we will know peace No matter how far down the scale we have gone. We will see how our experience can benefit others. That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear. We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows. Self-seeking will slip away. Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change. Fear of people and economic insecurity will leave us. We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us. We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves. Are these extravagant promises? We think not.

451,"Morning comes too early , And night time falls too late. And sometimes all I want to do is wait. The shadow I've been hiding in Has fled from me today. I know it's easier To walk away, Than look it in the eye. But I will raise a shelter to the sky And here beneath this star tonight I'll lie She will slowly yield the light As I awaken from the longest night. Dreams are shaking set sirens waking up tired eyes With the light the memories all rush into his head. By a candle stands a mirror of his heart and soul she dances She was dancing through the night above his bed. And walking to the window He throws the shutters out against the wall And from an ivory tower hears her call ""Let light surround you"" It's been a long, long time He's had a while to think it over In the end he only sees the change Light to dark Dark to light Light to dark Dark to light Heaven must be more than this When angels waken with a kiss Sacred hearts won't take the pain But mine will never be the same He stands before the window His shadow slowly fading from the wall And from an ivory tower he hears her call ""Let the light surround you"" Once I was but I was found. When I heard the stained glass Shatter all around me. She whispers words to clear my mind. I once could see but now at last, I'm blind. I know it's easier To walk away, Than look it in the eye. But I have given all that I could take. And now I've only habits left to break. Tonight I'll still be lying here surrounded In all the light.",Dream Theater

Just what I saw, in my old dreams, Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me. 'Cause in my dreams, it's always there, The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair. The night was black, was no use holding back, 'Cause I had to see, was someone watching me. In the mist, dark figures move and twist, Was all this for real, or just some kind of hell. 666 the number of the beast. Hell and fire was spawned to be released. Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised, As they start to cry, hands held to the sky. In the night, the fires burning bright, The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done. 666 the number of the beast. Sacrifice is going on tonight. This can't go on, I must inform the law. Can this still be real or just some crazy dream. But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes, They seem to mesmerize...can't avoid their eyes, 666 the number of the beast. 666 the one for you and me.

Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised, As they start to cry, hands held to the sky.
